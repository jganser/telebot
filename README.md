# Telebot

A simple telegram bot in python.

This project is base of a docker image that is available on docker hub at: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/yogadocs/telebot

Simply pull the latest image with: ```docker pull yogadocs/telebot```

The image can be used to monitor the behaviour of the bot, but more importantly it will configure the bot with the given token to behave like it is described in the [telebot.py](src/telebot.py) file.
